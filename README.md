**Prompt Optimization for generative art models**
This paper discusses the optimization of prompts for
generating AI art [1]. Popular AI models, such as stable diffusion
and MidJourney, are explored by guiding image generation with
prompts. However, the generated art’s quality depends on the
prompts’ quality, which may not always reflect the user’s desires.
To address this issue, we present a novel approach to improve
user prompts through epimerizing, using a trained machine
learning model on corpus data. Our approach is demonstrated to
improve the quality of AI art generated with prompts, providing
a more accurate reflection of user preferences. This research
contributes to AI art generation, highlighting the importance of
prompt optimization for achieving high-quality results.
